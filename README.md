# unOfficial Trailhead Leaderbord 

It's just a bunch of code.

Test classes probably don't work very well any more

I use phantomjs to do headless browsing and I use the free keys 

https://dashboard.phantomjscloud.com/

Please don't be to critical of my work. It's my first true Salesforce project and has evolved over the years since first going online ...

I've spent literally 100's of hours working in this Org to figure Salesforce out.

Thanks to https://adamtoarchitect.com/ for the encouragement ...

as of summer 2021 the phantomjs calls do not pull in the data any more. I;m not sure but I think it is related to shadow DOM, etc.

I've had to create a pure Javascript solution made of slenium, jsforce and node to update the data until the next time SF changes things again.

I'll try to put up a repo of that project once I clean some stuff up...
